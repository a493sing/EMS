# EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The project aims at developing an online Event Management System where users have a one stop solution for organizing their events. It would provide links to contact respective business owners for things like Event Space, Catering, Flowers, Dresses etc. There would be three types of accounts: a user account, a business account and an admin account.

We plan to use the following technologies like Python, Flask, Angular or Node Js or React (Front End), MySQL or MongoDB for database.
